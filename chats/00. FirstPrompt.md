Build a minimal but fully functional book review platform with both frontend and backend. The platform should include:

1. Basic user authentication (sign up, login, logout). Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). Data model: User ID, email, hashed password, name

2. Books Listing & Search: View a paginated list of all books, Search books by title or author, Data model: Book ID, title, author, description, cover image (URL), genres, published year

3. CRUD operations for book reviews (create, read, update, delete). Data model: Review ID, book ID, user ID, text, rating (1â€“5), timestamp

4. Rating aggregation for each book (average rating display). Automatically updated when a review is added/edited/deleted

5. User Profile: List of reviews written, Favourite books (user can mark/unmark)

6. A simple recommendation feature based on user ratings and reviews. use LLM based service APIs like OpenAI to provide recommendations

7. Ensure the UI is clean and intuitive, and the backend is structured to support scalability.

8. Unit Testing: Write unit test cases for the backend service and make sure overall code coverage is more than 80%

9. Deployment: A public backend repo with code, PRD, design, task breakdown md files. terraform script and pipeline scripts for deployment, commit code coverage repo. A public frontend repo with code, PRD, design, task breakdown md files. terraform script and pipeline scripts for deployment.

I'll help you build a comprehensive book review platform. Based on your detailed requirements, I'll create a feature spec that breaks this down into a structured development plan.

Let me start by creating the requirements document for this book review platform.

Created

requirements.md


I've created a comprehensive requirements document for your book review platform. The requirements are structured using the EARS format and cover all the key aspects you mentioned:

User Authentication with JWT tokens and secure password handling
Book Catalog with search, pagination, and detailed book information
Review System with full CRUD operations and rating functionality
Rating Aggregation that automatically updates when reviews change
User Profiles with review history and favorite books
AI Recommendations using OpenAI API for personalized suggestions
Scalable Architecture designed for growth and maintainability
Comprehensive Testing with 80%+ coverage requirements
Deployment Automation with Terraform and CI/CD pipelines
Clean UI/UX with responsive design and accessibility
Each requirement includes detailed acceptance criteria that will guide the implementation process.

Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll create the design document based on these requirements. Let me research the best practices for building scalable book review platforms and then develop a comprehensive technical design.

Created

design.md


I've created a comprehensive design document that covers all aspects of your book review platform. The design includes:

Architecture Highlights:

Modern microservices-inspired architecture with separate frontend/backend repos
Node.js/TypeScript backend with Express.js and PostgreSQL
React/TypeScript frontend with modern state management
AWS cloud infrastructure with proper scalability considerations
Key Design Features:

Detailed database schema with proper relationships
Comprehensive API interface definitions
Component-based frontend architecture
Robust error handling strategies
Extensive testing approach targeting 80%+ coverage
Performance optimization with caching and monitoring
Infrastructure as code with Terraform
Technical Decisions:

JWT authentication with secure password hashing
Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
React Query for efficient server state management
OpenAI integration for AI-powered recommendations
Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
The design addresses scalability, maintainability, and all your specified requirements while following modern development best practices.

Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan that breaks down this comprehensive book review platform into manageable, sequential coding tasks. This will provide a clear roadmap for building both the backend and frontend with proper testing and deployment automation.

Created

tasks.md


I've created a comprehensive implementation plan that breaks down your book review platform into 24 manageable, sequential tasks. The plan is structured to build incrementally:

Backend Development (Tasks 1-12):

Project setup and infrastructure configuration
Database and ORM setup with Prisma
Authentication system with JWT
Book catalog management with search and pagination
Review system with full CRUD operations
Rating aggregation automation
User profiles and favorites
AI-powered recommendations with OpenAI
Comprehensive testing suite (80%+ coverage)
AWS infrastructure with Terraform
CI/CD pipeline automation
Frontend Development (Tasks 13-22):

React/TypeScript project setup
Authentication UI and protected routing
Book catalog and search interface
Review management interface
User profile and favorites UI
Recommendation system interface
Responsive design and accessibility
Frontend testing suite
AWS deployment infrastructure
Frontend CI/CD pipeline
Integration & Documentation (Tasks 23-24):

Comprehensive documentation
End-to-end testing and optimization
Each task includes:

Clear coding objectives
Specific technical requirements
References to the original requirements
Incremental building approach
Testing integration throughout
The plan ensures proper test coverage, scalable architecture, and complete deployment automation as requested.

Do the tasks look good?

Perfect! Your book review platform spec is now complete with comprehensive requirements, detailed technical design, and a structured implementation plan.

The spec includes:

10 detailed requirements covering authentication, book management, reviews, ratings, user profiles, AI recommendations, scalable architecture, testing, deployment, and UI/UX
Complete technical design with modern tech stack (Node.js/TypeScript backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL, AWS infrastructure)
24 sequential implementation tasks that build the platform incrementally with proper testing and deployment automation
You can now begin executing the tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with Task 1 to set up the backend project structure, then working through the tasks sequentially for the best development experience.

The implementation plan is designed to deliver a production-ready book review platform with 80%+ test coverage, comprehensive documentation, and automated deployment pipelines for both frontend and backend repositories.
