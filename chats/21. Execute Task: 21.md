Execute Task: 21. Create frontend deployment infrastructure with Terraform

update the stucture like this:

WordWise/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── infrastructure/
│ ├── frontend/
│ ├── backend/

also move backend setup under the above folder structure


I'll help you restructure the project to match the desired folder layout. Let me first understand the current structure and then create the new organization.
