- **Performance testing** with Core Web Vitals monitoring

### ✅ **2. Integration Tests for Complete User Workflows**
- **Authentication workflows** (registration, login, logout, password reset)
- **Book management workflows** (browsing, searching, filtering, details)
- **Review system workflows** (creating, editing, deleting reviews)
- **Recommendation workflows** (AI-powered suggestions, popular books)
- **User profile workflows** (profile management, favorites, history)
- **Search and filter workflows** (advanced search, genre filtering)

### ✅ **3. Load Testing for System Performance**
- **Concurrent user testing** (10, 50, 100, 200 users)
- **API load testing** with response time monitoring
- **Database performance testing** under load
- **Memory usage monitoring** during high load
- **Throughput measurement** and optimization

### ✅ **4. Database Query Optimization**

```bash
./scripts/run-comprehensive-tests.sh
```

### **Run Specific Test Suites:**
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm run test:comprehensive

# Frontend tests  
cd frontend
npm run test:comprehensive

# Load testing
npm run test:load

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
```

### **Start Monitoring Dashboard:**
