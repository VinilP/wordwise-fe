## Frontend Test Failure Analysis

### üîç **Main Categories of Failures:**

#### 1. **Component Behavior Mismatches** (Most Common)
- **BookSearch**: Tests expecting "Active" text that doesn't exist in current component
- **FavoriteButton**: Tests expecting "Add to Favorites" text that's not rendered
- **ReviewForm**: Tests expecting validation errors with `role="alert"` that aren't present
- **RecommendationCard**: Tests expecting `role="progressbar"` that doesn't exist

#### 2. **Jest vs Vitest Compatibility Issues**
- **RecommendationErrorBoundary**: Multiple tests failing due to `jest` not being defined (should use `vi` instead)

#### 3. **Accessibility/Event Handling**
- **AccessibleButton**: Custom `onKeyDown` handler not being called as expected

### üéØ **Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Text Content Changes**: Many components have changed their text content or structure, but tests haven't been updated
2. **Validation Behavior**: Form validation doesn't show errors the way tests expect
3. **Accessibility Roles**: Some components don't have the ARIA roles that tests are looking for
4. **Testing Framework**: Some tests still use Jest syntax instead of Vitest

### üîß **Specific Test Failures:**

#### BookSearch Component
- **Issue**: Tests expect "Active" text for filter indicators
- **Current Behavior**: Component shows "Active filters:" with count badges
- **Fix Needed**: Update test selectors to match actual component text

#### FavoriteButton Component
- **Issue**: Tests expect "Add to Favorites" text
- **Current Behavior**: Component shows only icon with tooltip
- **Fix Needed**: Update test to check for tooltip text instead

#### ReviewForm Component
- **Issue**: Tests expect validation errors with `role="alert"`
- **Current Behavior**: Component disables submit button instead of showing errors
- **Fix Needed**: Update tests to check button disabled state

#### RecommendationCard Component
- **Issue**: Tests expect `role="progressbar"` for confidence score
- **Current Behavior**: Component uses div with inline styles
- **Fix Needed**: Add proper ARIA role or update test expectations

#### RecommendationErrorBoundary Component
- **Issue**: Tests use `jest` syntax instead of `vi`
- **Current Behavior**: Vitest environment doesn't recognize `jest`
- **Fix Needed**: Replace `jest.spyOn` with `vi.spyOn` and `jest.restoreAllMocks` with `vi.restoreAllMocks`

### ‚úÖ Frontend Accessibility Tests
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Test Suites:** 1 passed, 1 total
- **Tests:** 25 passed, 25 total
- **Duration:** 3.04s

- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance
- Form accessibility

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend Performance Tests
- **Status:** PARTIALLY PASSED
